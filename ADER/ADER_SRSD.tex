\section{Introduction}

\section{RSICC Codes}
I have successfully managed to install MCNP6.1, SERPENT, ORIGEN2.2, MOCUP, and
MONTEBURNS on my laptop. I have managed to compile all of them and have successfully
tested MCNP, SERPENT, MONTEBURNS, and ORIGEN2.2 (via testing of MONTEBURNS, which uses
the ORIGEN2.2 files).
Additionally, I registered on the SERPENT user forums and between them and google managed
to install and update the gd graphics library on my laptop; an issue that was preventing
successful compilation of SERPENT for several days. Also got the latest updates for
SERPENT installed and compiled.
In terms of projects, I've created a highly simplistic spherical reactor in SERPENT
that uses a very detailed material composition for the reactor vessel (Hastelloy N
modified with Ti, Nb, and W) and a basic material composition for the fuel salt used
by the MSBR. This was really just to test SERPENT.
Through this file though I discovered that something was amiss with my bk account as I
have since learned that I didn't have permissions to submit batch files to run jobs. Additionally,
if I simply were to log into a node and try and run SERPENT I got a seg fault. Ryan and I
believe we have diagnosed the issues. For starters, I was not given SLURM permissions
in the original creation of my account; this accounts for not being able to submit jobs.
Through the issues with SERPENT Ryan found that the new MPI compilation of SERPENT
was corrupt and I believe he is working on this currently.

\section{General Computational Knowledge}
In addition to working on the nuclear specific codes, I have, of course, had to become
more acquainted with vim, scripts, and in my creation of this document here, \LaTeX.
I've learned some basics of how to configure a vimrc file, as well as dependencies. I've
learned the very rudimentary basics of script files, but at least enough to write simple
ones and to understand those which we submit to Berkelium. Currently, and I suspect
through several iterations of this document I am learning more and more of how to use
\LaTeX. I opted to go without Lynx for now if for no other reason than this will help
me to understand Lynx down the road and what it does exactly. I intend for this document
to be simple; I'm happy with getting the title to work, \LaTeX{} to print out correctly, and the
sections to be correct. As I expected, this is something akin to the sixth major revision of this
document.

\section{Coming Work}
While the above concludes my work for the past 2 weeks, now that I have the codes installed
and working and now that, soon, I should be able to run things on BK, my next project
is to read into the Russian work on the new salt with supposedly high solubility of
actinides. This will probably spawn quite a bit of investigations into chemistry and
related literature. Either way, from there I intend to look into the MIT team's work.
